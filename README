Octy is a mobile game where you play as an octopus, eating everything smaller than you and growing bigger.

Built with Cursor using cursor-small.

Trying out PyGame. Using this as a way of learning mobile development.

Run with

`python main.py`

currently (need to obviously build for mobile eventually)

Very rough quick "hello world" so far. Planning to add a core mechanism of eating objects and growing.
